RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
A fundamental neural network architecture for sequential data, where the output from the previous step is fed as input to the current step.
SVM (Support Vector Machine)
A powerful and versatile machine learning model capable of performing linear or non-linear classification, regression, and even outlier detection.
Linear Regression
A simple yet effective statistical model for predicting a quantitative response.
Random Forest
An ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as:
MSE (Mean Squared Error): Measures the average of the squares of the errors.
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): The square root of the MSE, providing an error metric in the same units as the target variable.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.
Detailed results, including performance graphs and comparison tables, will be generated and can be found in the results/ directory after running the prediction scripts.
