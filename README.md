Introduction
Predicting cryptocurrency prices is a challenging yet crucial task for investors and traders. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a robust and accurate Bitcoin price predictor. It leverages popular libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, and Pandas to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate their performance.
Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for cleaning, normalizing, and preparing historical Bitcoin data.
Multiple Models: Implements and compares different machine learning models, including:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
Linear Regression
Random Forest
Hyperparameter Tuning: Explores methods for optimizing model parameters to improve prediction accuracy.
Visualization: Provides tools to visualize data trends, model predictions, and performance metrics.
Evaluation Metrics: Uses standard metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess model performance.
Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
Clone the repository:
code
Bash
git clone https://github.com/siddarthagorentla/Bitcoin_Price_Predictor.git
cd Bitcoin_Price_Predictor
Create a virtual environment (recommended):
code
Bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:
code
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Once installed, you can run the prediction script:
code
Bash
python predict_bitcoin.py
This will execute the default prediction pipeline, which typically includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. You can modify predict_bitcoin.py or create new scripts to experiment with different models or parameters.
Data
The project expects historical Bitcoin price data, typically in a CSV format. The data/ directory is where you should place your dataset. A sample dataset might include columns such as:
Date
Open
High
Low
Close
Volume
Note: Ensure your data is clean and consistently formatted for optimal model performance.
Models
This project explores a variety of machine learning models for Bitcoin price prediction. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses:
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
LSTMs are a type of RNN particularly well-suited for time series prediction due to their ability to learn long-term dependencies.

RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
A fundamental neural network architecture for sequential data, where the output from the previous step is fed as input to the current step.
SVM (Support Vector Machine)
A powerful and versatile machine learning model capable of performing linear or non-linear classification, regression, and even outlier detection.
Linear Regression
A simple yet effective statistical model for predicting a quantitative response.
Random Forest
An ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as:
MSE (Mean Squared Error): Measures the average of the squares of the errors.
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): The square root of the MSE, providing an error metric in the same units as the target variable.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.
Detailed results, including performance graphs and comparison tables, will be generated and can be found in the results/ directory after running the prediction scripts.
